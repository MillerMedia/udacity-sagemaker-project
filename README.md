# SageMaker Deployment Project

The notebook and Python files provided here, once completed, result in a simple web app which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the mini-project, Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost, should provide enough background.

For reviewers:
NOTE that I have shut down the Sagemaker endpoint and the API gateway to save on costs so the index.html will not run successfully. If needed, I can recreate.
